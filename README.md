# Handling Null and Empty Lists in Kotlin's map Function
This example showcases the correct way to handle null values and empty lists when using the `map` function in Kotlin.  It prevents common `NullPointerExceptions` and ensures robust code.

The `BuggyMap.kt` file contains the initial code that might throw exceptions, while `FixedMap.kt` demonstrates the solution.

## Problem:
The original code lacks proper null checks when processing lists that might be null or empty. This leads to runtime errors.

## Solution:
The improved code uses the safe call operator (`?.`) and the Elvis operator (`?:`) to gracefully handle null values and empty lists. This ensures that the `map` function doesn't crash and provides appropriate output even in exceptional circumstances.

## How to Run:
1. Save the code in two Kotlin files named `BuggyMap.kt` and `FixedMap.kt`.
2. Compile and run the Kotlin files using your preferred Kotlin compiler and runtime environment.
